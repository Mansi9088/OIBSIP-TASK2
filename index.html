          <h2>Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680
            was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.
            Eventually, Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire.
             In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.
             Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death,
              he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement,
               as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.
